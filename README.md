# Sentiment Analysis on Twitter data

There are many indicators that suggest the economy is headed for a recession, including high 
inflation, consumer sentiment drops, volatile stock markets, rising interest rates and tight housing 
markets. Unemployment rates are still at a pre-pandemic low of 3.5%, according to the latest jobs 
report. The number of layoffs is increasing, however. American citizens are already predicting a 
downturn, according to most polls. Layoffs are definitely a trending topic in recent times. A drop 
in consumer spending and rising interest rates have led to a significant reduction in job losses, 
mainly in the tech, mortgage, and housing industries. Many major companies have announced 
downsizing and cutbacks in recent weeks, including Wayfair, Apple, and Walmart.

Twitter is a leading social media platform where people from all walks of life and professions are 
very vocal about their opinions on various issues. In the last few months, there has been a lot of 
discussion regarding the job market and how various factors like inflation, interest rates, etc., are 
affecting it. In a recent interview with CNN, President Biden told “I don’t think there will be a 
recession. If it is, it’ll be a very slight recession”, which caused quite a stir in public’s opinions on 
twitter. This comes amidst the news of layoffs and slow hiring by many major companies and 
renowned economists warning about a potential downturn. With this study, I aim to use 
sentiment analysis as a means to understand how people are reacting to the current situation with 
regards to the job market and if they agree/disagree with if we may/may not be in a recession.
